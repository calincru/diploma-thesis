As modern networks become increasingly complex and more and more operators move
towards Network Function Virtualization as a way of reducing costs for
purchasing and upgrading middleboxes, verifying certain properties of networks
built around iptables-enabled devices becomes one of the top priorities in
network verification today.  Thus, we create a model of an iptables-enhanced
router which can be fed to SymNet, a fast symbolic execution tool for stateful
networks, and show how it can be used in practice.

We thoroughly evaluate the model on two dimensions: correctness and
performance.  The former is related to the equivalence between the semantics of
our model and the real implementation of iptables, while the latter quantifies
the quality of the model in terms of the running time of SymNet when run
against it.
